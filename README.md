Today I'll be working on a Recipe project. The purpose of it is to showcase what I have learned so far. 
It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The skills to be demonstrated are:
-How to set up an .html
-How to add body context, titles and more
-How to add links
-How to add pictures
